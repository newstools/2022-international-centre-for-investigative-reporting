The president, in the letter, stated that the provision amounted to the disenfranchisement of political appointees. Specifically, Buhari asked the National Assembly to amend Section 84 (2) Sub-section 12, which stipulated that no political appointee shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of any candidate for an election. In the letter, he said the amendment was necessary as the clause constituted a fundamental defect that led to the disenfranchisement of political officeholders. The ICIR reported that Buhari signed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law on February 25. While signing the law, Buhari had drawn the attention of the National Assembly to Section 84 (12), noting that the provision constituted a fundamental defect as it conflicted with extant constitutional provisions.
