The ICIR had reported that the scarcity of aviation fuel has been forcing major airlines in the country to delay and even cancel flights, as the product sold for close to N700 per litre across the country. Checks by The ICIR on websites of Air Peace, United Nigeria Airlines, Arik Air, Green Africa and Dana Air showed that one-way ticket prices for Lagos to Abuja were being priced above N50,000 across business and even economy packages. Similarly, it was observed that these airlines were reducing their frequencies to manage the situation. For Air Peace, one-way tickets from Lagos to Abuja on March 16, 2022, were sold for as high as N70,000. This was observed on 6:30 am, 8:40 am and 10:30 am flights.

During an investigative hearing on scarcity of aviation fuel by the House of Representatives ad hoc committee on March 14, Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) and the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) agreed to peg the price of Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK) also known as Jet A1 fuel at N500 per litre from the current price of N630. The new price will be in place for 72 hours, after which the marketers and the AON are to agree on new price modalities. The chairperson of MOMAN, Olumide Adeosun, said the marketers have been selling fuel to the operators on credit. “For most of the airlines, we have increased their credit — for Arik we were trading N115 million at the end of the year. We are now at N150 million, for Air Peace, we were at N120 million, but now we are at N200 million. At any given period, those accounts are delinquent. That is a fact,” he said. During the hearing, the Chairperson of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, said the operators would be forced to increase flight to N120,000 per ticket for economy class. According to Onyema, it costs operators N7 million to fly from Abuja to Kano on a standard 130-seater aircraft. On March 16, Air Peace, in a statement, attempted to withdraw Onyema’s statement by terming it “a piece of misinformation.” The statement read: “Onyema was reported to have said ‘airlines will increase ticket fare to N120,000 naira’. This statement was clearly taken out of context by the media. These were his exact words: “From what is happening, if we continue this way (the increasing fuel price), the least ticket you’ll expect from airlines will be N120,000 for Economy and we don’t want to do that because it will not help the ordinary man”. “The Air Peace Chairman has the interest of the flying public at heart and will not make statements or take actions that suggest the contrary. Also, he made those statements under the auspices of the AON and not Air Peace,” the statement read. MOMAN has accused many airline operators of owing marketers and other industry players millions of naira. Its Executive Secretary, Clement Isong advised that the airlines adopt a pricing formula for the procurement of aviation fuel.
