Justice Inyang Ekwo ruled that Umahi could not transfer the votes that got him into power on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The judge ordered INEC to stop recognising Umahi and his deputy, and directed the PDP to send names to the electoral umpire as their replacement. The court said Umahi forfeited his governorship position when he defected from the PDP to the APC in 2020. Umahi had described the judgment as a “sham”. He accused the judge of doing a “hatchet job”, saying he was on a mission to embarrass the APC and the Federal Government. In compliance with the court order, the PDP has nominated a member of the House of Representatives Iduma Enwo Igariwey to replace Umahi as Ebonyi State governor. The party also nominated Fred Udogwu to replace Kelechi Igwe as deputy governor. The PDP has asked INEC to issue Igariwey and Udogwu with certificates of return so they can be sworn in immediately.
