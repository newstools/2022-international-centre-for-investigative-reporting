Kyari denied the charges but two co-defendants – Umeibe and Ezenwanne – pleaded guilty. Umeibe and Ezenwanne were alleged to have unlawfully imported 21.35kg of cocaine on or about January 25, 2022, at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, an offense contrary to and punishable under section 11(a) of the NDLEA Act, CAP N30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. Kyari was declared wanted by the NDLEA, and later arrested, for allegedly engaging in drug trafficking. The ICIR reported that the Federal Government has approved the request by the United States to extradite Kyari over his alleged link to a $1.1million wire fraud involving Abass Ramon, aka Hushpuppi.
