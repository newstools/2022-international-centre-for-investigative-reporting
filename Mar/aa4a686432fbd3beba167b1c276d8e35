Meanwhile, the Nigeria Network of Non-Governmental Organisations (NNNGO) has blamed the sole control of COVID-19 vaccines, testing, and treatments by large pharmaceutical companies as the main threat to the fight against the virus. The group said the monopoly put the world at risk of the virus’s next lethal form. NNNGO executive Director Oyebisi Oluseyi said this at a news conference in Lagos. “Heading into our third year of the pandemic, billions of people worldwide still don’t have access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatment. “Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies are recording profits of over one million dollars per hour. “The lack of strong government action in the face of pharmaceutical monopoly greed is causing thousands of needless deaths each day,” Oluseyi said.
