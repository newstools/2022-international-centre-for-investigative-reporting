Bayelsa, Borno and Ekiti States have the least number of health facilities in Nigeria. The Nigeria Health Facility Registry (HFR) data show that Bayelsa and Borno have 311 and 537 facilities, respectively, while Ekiti has 570. Yobe and Rivers follow with 586 hospitals each. The HFR, keeping the records of all hospitals and clinics in the country, shows that states with fewer health institutions have more of their population depending on a facility for treatment. The situation could deny many residents access to services.

In contrast, a hospital serves a maximum of two thousand people in Nasarawa State because the state has 1337 health facilities for its population. However, depending on some factors including the quality of workers, infrastructures and welfare, the number of hospitals a state has does not determine the quality of services its people get. Health facilities captured by the HFR comprise primary, secondary and tertiary hospitals, both public and private.
