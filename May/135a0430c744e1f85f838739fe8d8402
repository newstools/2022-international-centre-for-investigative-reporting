Fatima, a pregnant woman and her four kids were gruesomely killed by IPOB terrorists in Anambra. A totally evil and inhuman act and should be condemned by all. — Bashir Ahmad (@BashirAhmaad) May 24, 2022  IPOB Terrorists want to continue attacking Northerners to incite Hausas against Ndigbos and cause a war that they believe would lead to the disintegration of Nigeria. Let us all, including myself, be careful not to be a tool by IPOB in the rally against the 99% peaceful Igbos. — ᴏnowvo_ᴏᴍᴀsᴏʀᴏ ᴀʟɪ ᴏᴠɪᴇ ™☤🇳🇬 (@OvieNews) May 24, 2022  This rubbish IPOB is doing in the east is terrorism. Using violence and intimidation against civilians. Call a spade a spade. — Dr. Chinonso Egemba (@aproko_doctor) May 23, 2022  The death of Fatima, a pregnant woman and her 4 children in Anambra is abominable! Our moral compass is broken on so many levels, no compass self! We are quickly planting the seeds of decadence & hatred of ourselves for our next generation! We may never get out of this rot! 💔 — Dj Switch (@dj_switchaholic) May 24, 2022  The killing of Fatima,her 4 kids & 6 other northerners yesterday in Anambra for nor reason is a challenge upon all those leaders, commentators & print-media that were all over condemning d killing of Deborah in Sokoto, who's crime was evident.

(@MansurSokoto) May 24, 2022  Just saw the devastating news of a pregnant woman named Fatima and her 4 kids who were murdered in Anambra state. We call on the State Government to ensure they capture the perpetrators to face the wrath of the law. 💔 — Mohammed Jammal (@whitenigerian) May 24, 2022  I condemn in the strongest of terms the killing of Fatima and her four innocent children by blood thirsty, crude and wicked terrorists parading as freedom fighters. I call on HE @CCSoludo to use his good office and bring the perforators of that dastard act to book. — Savn Daniel (@savndaniel) May 25, 2022  May the soul of Fatima and her four kids rest in peace. This kind of brutal and senseless murder of innocent citizens, especially CHILDREN, is evil. This is terrorism point blank. Animals! — Dr Dípò Awójídé (@OgbeniDipo) May 24, 2022  Meanwhile, IPOB has said it has no hand in the killing. “IPOB has nothing whatsoever to do with the death of a Hausa woman who was with her children on Sunday and we strongly condemn the dastard act by criminals sponsored by Northern politicians,” IPOB spokesman Emma Powerful said in a report by PUNCH. “The ESN (Eastern Security Network) does not work like bandits and terrorists because we know what human blood represents,” the IPOB spokesman added while claiming that “terrorists and jihadists” allegedly imported into the South-East were behind the killings and other violent incidents in the zone in recent times.
