Osinbajo called on all Nigerians to condemn the killing. “What took place in Anambra with the killing of a woman and her children demeans us all. It is such a callous act and so brutal,” he said. “I think that we must be very careful, as a people, with this type of killings that are going on, especially where it is obviously to create such horror, annoyance and create a situation where we begin to have ethnic conflicts again and all that. “We must all be careful and condemn it in the strongest possible terms, there is no excuse for it whatsoever. We must not allow a situation where we get to the point where we even countenance individuals who can do this sort of thing.”
