A FEDERAL High Court sitting in Yenagoa has declared that former President, Goodluck Jonathan, is eligible to contest the 2023 presidential election. Justice Isa Hamma Dashen, the presiding judge, made the declaration today in a judgment in the case FHC/YNG/CS/2022. The judge also held that Jonathan’s right to vie for the office of President again could not be stopped by any retroactive law. On behalf of Jonathan, the plaintiff Andy Solomon, had approached the court, claiming that the former President was “very constitutionally, ethically, and legally qualified to contest the 2023 presidential election”.
