By Dare Akogun VICE President Yemi Osibanjo has said that his experience under President Muhammadu Buhari in the last seven years has placed him above other presidential aspirants.

The vice president was in Ilorin for a meeting with All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates ahead of the party’s May 30, 2022 presidential primary election. According to him “Working under President Muhammadu Buhari in the last seven years has greatly exposed me to series of security and economic challenges facing the country which I am in a better position to address due to exposure and opportunities given to me by the President.” “Being the Vice President of Nigeria in the last few years was a great opportunity that placed me in the front burner against other aspirants contesting for the presidency.
