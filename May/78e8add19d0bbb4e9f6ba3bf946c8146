THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has adjourned its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting following the inability of stakeholders to agree on zoning. After a three-hour meeting between caucus members and governors in the early hours of Wednesday, the NEC meeting was adjourned to 8:00 pm to enable the party stakeholders agree on the zoning of the party’s presidential ticket. Following the new development, the National Caucus meeting will be held at 4:00;pm; Board of Trustees meeting at 7:00 pm, while the NEC meeting will be by 8:00 pm. It would be recalled that the NEC meeting earlier rescheduled for May 10 was postponed to May 11 after the party’s National Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu, issued a statement saying that the date clashed with the local governments’ delegates’ election involving all members of the party.
