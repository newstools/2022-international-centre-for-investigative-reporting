Civil unrest had erupted at the Dei-Dei building market on Wednesday. The crisis which resulted in the burning down of shops and properties left many residents scampering for safety. A resident of the area identified as Abdullahi, told The ICIR that a trailer had crushed a pregnant woman to death after a bike man conveying her fell while trying to overtake the vehicle. “What happened is that an okada man who was carrying a pregnant woman wanted to overtake a trailer so an accident happened and the woman died. “The incident happened where they sell building materials. They burnt his machine and he went and called his people. They came and started burning shops and warehouses,” Abdullahi said.
