The statement read, “Following the Independent National Electoral Commission’s extension of deadline for the submission of list of candidates by political parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) hereby postpones its Special Convention for Presidential Primary from Sunday, 29th – Monday, 30th of May, 2020 to Monday, 6th – Wednesday, 8th of June, 2022.” The ICIR had earlier reported the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to extend the primaries deadline by six days after meeting with the 18 registered political parties under the aegis of the Inter-Party Advisory Council IPAC, on Friday in Abuja. The IPAC had earlier asked for a two-month extension from the June 3rd deadline, a demand which the Commission rejected. Festus Okoye, INEC National Electoral Commissioner for Information and Voter Education, said the extension was to give parties more time to compile the list and details of their nominated candidates before uploading them to the  INEC portal.
