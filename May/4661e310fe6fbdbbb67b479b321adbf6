THE Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, has said he will consult President Muhammadu Buhari and his constituents before deciding on whether or not to resign from the Federal Executive Council (FEC). Asked to react to the President’s directive that cabinet members seeking elective offices in the 2023 general elections should resign before May 16, Ngige said a window period was given for those that need clarifications on the development.

The ICIR had earlier reported that Buhari, on Wednesday, ordered members of the FEC who have ambition to contest in 2023 general elections to resign on or before May 16.
