FORMER Ekiti State Deputy Governor Olusola Eleka has withdrawn from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial primary election in the state. His withdrawal was disclosed in a letter he addressed to the party’s National Chairman Iyorchia Ayu, on Thursday. In the letter sighted by The ICIR, Eleka based his decision on the alleged betrayal by the state’s former governor Ayo Fayose.
