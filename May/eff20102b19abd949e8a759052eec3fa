The sound engineer was reportedly lynched and set on fire. Nigerians have taken to social media, especially Twitter, to demand the arrest and prosecution of the perpetrators through the hashtag #JusticeforDave. The Police Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, in a post on Twitter, said, “How would someone kill a fellow human being just because of 100 naira or a mere argument? I feel sad as a traditional man, police officer, PR practitioner, and archaeologist, to see things like this, and observe the level of decadence in moral values and Africanism in us.” A Twitter user, Zzetta, said: “This is Dave! Sound engineer. Profiled wrongly by a mob, accused, killed and burnt brutally. #JusticeforDave”. Another Twitter user, Dr. Penking added, “This didn’t happen in Kaduna, Sokoto or Taraba. This happened in Lagos State, the heart of Yoruba land. Dave was not a thief. Dave was not a fraudster. Dave was not a  criminal. Dave was a young Nigerian struggling and making an honest living. #JusticeforDave.”
