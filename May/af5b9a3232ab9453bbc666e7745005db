Pope Francis said he will hold a consistory (a meeting of the Council of Cardinals) on the new Cardinals on August 27, and will also meet with them on the same day for discussions on church matters.  “On Saturday, 27 August, I will hold a consistory for the creation of new cardinals. Let us pray that they will help me in my mission as Bishop of Rome for the good of all God’s people,” the Pope was quoted as saying.
