In his earlier submission, the prosecution counsel, Lamido Sorondinki, informed the court that the convict committed the offence sometime in 2019 at Karkasara Quarters in the Kano metropolis. Sorondinki said that the defendant kidnapped his sister’s son, Ado, sealed his mouth and nose with a tape and abducted him. The five-year-old was later reportedly buried in a shallow grave. “The defendant kidnapped his sister’s son, Ado, and in the process, used a seal tape to cover his nose and mouth, resulting in suffocation leading to his death,” Sorondinki told the court. “He buried him in a shallow grave at Sabuwar Sheka, Kano.” Sorondinki told the court. The prosecution presented three witnesses to the court and four exhibits to prove their case against the defendant. The convict, however, denied committing the offence. According to the prosecutor, the offence contravened sections 274 and 221 (a) of the Penal Code.
