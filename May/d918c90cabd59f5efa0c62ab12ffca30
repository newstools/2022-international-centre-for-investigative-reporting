No parent should experience the heartbreak of watching their child die. “UNICEF stands alongside the authorities and partners on the ground to provide support, the necessary assistance to these families and prevent further tragedies,” the UN agency said in a statement. Senegalese President, Macky Sall said on his Twitter page that he received the news “with pain and consternation.” Both Sall and the country’s minister of health, Abdoulaye Sarr, were outside the nation when the tragedy struck. While Sall was in Angola on an official visit, Sarr was in Geneva for the World Health Assembly. The minister promised to cut his trip short and return home following the incident. He said preliminary investigations showed that a short circuit caused the blaze. Wednesday’s inferno occurred a year after a similar blaze killed four newborns at a facility in Linguere, a small town located in the country’s north, in the Louga region.
