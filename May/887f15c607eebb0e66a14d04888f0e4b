Reports say many of the insurgents surrounded the harmless civilians and killed them. Meanwhile, efforts to reach the Army spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu, and Pubic Relations Officer of Borno State Police Command, Sani Mohammed, were unsuccessful. They didn’t respond to calls and messages sent to their phones by The ICIR. The attack comes almost two years after over 40 farmers were killed in Borno. The farmers were killed by suspected Boko Haram members while harvesting their crops in the farm.
