OSUN State Governor Gboyega Oyetola flagged off his reelection campaign on Thursday, saying the affairs of the state cannot be left in the hands of those he described as kindergarten politicians. The governor kicked off his campaign for a second term in office at Ile-Ife. During a courtesy visit to the Palace of the Ooni of Ife Adeyeye Ogunwusi, the governor said although he does not have money to purchase private jets for traditional rulers, he has the capacity to transform the state.

It is costly to allow such people to experiment with Osun,” Oyetola said. He attributed the decision to flag off his re-election campaign at Ife to the strong successes and victories the town had brought to his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), in past elections. Oyetola, who highlighted some of his achievements across various sectors, promised that his administration would not relent in delivering democratic dividends for the people of the state.
