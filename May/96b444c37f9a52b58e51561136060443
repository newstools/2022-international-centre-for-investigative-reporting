Deborah was attacked for condemning the sharing of religious messages on an academic WhatsApp group. She said the group was meant for school work which included tests and assignments and demanded that messages related to ‘the messenger of Allah’ were not part of it, a move interpreted by her attackers as blasphemy. The Sokoto State government ordered an investigation into Deborah’s murder, although it did not expressly condemn the incident. The Police Command in the State, however, said in a statement on Friday that it has arrested two people in connection with the murder.
