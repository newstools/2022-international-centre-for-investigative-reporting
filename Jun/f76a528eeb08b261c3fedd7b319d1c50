A POPULAR radio anchor and owner of the Human Rights Radio in Abuja FCT, Ahmed Isah in a live broadcast said that he is crowdfunding for the university students to resume academic activities. This was announced in a live programme on Thursday during the Brekete Family radio show where he volunteered to intervene in the ongoing negotiations between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Isah pledged to give N10 million and called on Nigerians to contribute to a designated bank account which was created that morning and posted on the Brekete Family social media pages. “Let us challenge ourselves as Nigerians. This is an opportunity for us to test ourselves to know how united we are. Come 2023, this ASUU intervention will give me a sign that, as masses, we are ready to turn things around,” he said on Thursday. During the radio show, Isah announced the payment of N1 million naira by the Deputy Registrar at the Institute of Chartered Mediators and Conciliators (ICMC) Segun Ogunyanwo. “Your one naira, N1,000 naira, N5000, N10,000 is not too small. No matter how poor you think you are, make sure you contribute something, even if it is one naira”, Isah said. Nigerians in the Diaspora called in during the live broadcast and promised to contribute their quota. It will be recalled that ASUU has been on strike for over three months. The unions’ demands consist of finances to revamp the nation’s public universities and welfare for its members. ASUU held that the strike will only be stopped when two of its demands are met. One is replacing the payment platform Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS) with University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS). The second demand is the execution of the renegotiated 2009 Agreement finalised in May 2021. The President of ASUU, Emmanuel Osodeke, and the Director of Press at the Federal Ministry of Education Ben Goong, were not available for comments during the radio program.
