THE Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) has debunked reports that Peter Nwachukwu, husband of late gospel singer Osinachi, escaped from the Kuje Prison when the facility was attacked by insurgents last week. There were reports that Nwachukwu was among 879 inmates, including about 69 terror suspects, who escaped in the jailbreak. However, Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the NCoS, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Command, Humphrey Chukwuedo denied the reports in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday. Chukwuedo also confirmed that a suspected kidnap kingpin Hamisu Bala, popularly known as Wadume, who is held in the facility, did not escape from custody. “The story is false, reckless and mischievous. They are still in custody. Efforts are ongoing to recapture all fleeing inmates. “The Controller-General, NCoS, Haliru Nababa, is determined to continue to upscale the inmates’ welfare and safety,” Chukwuedo said. Nwachukwu was remanded in the Kuje Prison by an Abuja High Court in June, pending the determination of a case filed against him. The Nigerian government had filed a 23-count charge against Nwachukwu. The charges include culpable homicide, punishable by death under Section 221 of the Penal Code. The case was filed in May by the Head, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Department of the Ministry of Justice, Yewande Gbola-Awopetun following allegations of domestic violence against Nwachukwu.
