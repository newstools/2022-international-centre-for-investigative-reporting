THE Center for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) has urged election observers monitoring the Osun State gubernatorial election holding on Saturday to beware of fake reports. Faith Nwadishi, the Executive Director of CTA, made the appeal at a training session for election observers in Osogbo, Osun State, on Thursday. Nwadishi advised observers not to be biased or partisan. She noted that the role of election observers cannot be overstated as they work with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that free, fair and credible elections are held. “Observers’ reports have helped INEC to improve on the electoral process by giving them information on areas they can work on, so giving a factual report is very essential”, she said. Nwadishi also advised the electorate against selling their votes, stressing that the act would affect the outcome of the election. Also speaking at the event, Ezenwa Nwagwu, who is the facilitator, stressed on the code of conduct for observers and warned them not to collect any form of gifts from politicians or community leaders. “Be diligent in doing your work as an observer, don’t interfere with the election officer’s work, and lastly, give an unbiased report,” he said. The training had in attendance election observers expected to be in the 30 local government areas of Osun State. CTA is a consortium of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) with the purpose of providing an independent and transparent assessment of public institutions in Nigeria.
