THE Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has announced plans to embark on a nationwide protest. The protest, slated for July 26 and 27, is in solidarity with the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). ASUU had embarked on strike since February 14 over the non-implementation of outstanding agreements with the Federal Government, as well as other demands. In a letter dated July 15 and addressed to chairpersons of the NLC in the states, Ayuba Wabba, the congress’ national president, and Emmanuel Ugboaja, the general secretary, said the protest is aimed at getting Nigerian students back to school and to support ASUU’s fight for quality education. The Labour House in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and secretariats of the NLC were designated as takeoff points for the protest. “In line with the decisions of the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the Nigeria Labour Congress held on the 30th of June 2022, we have scheduled National Days of Protest to get our children back to school and support our unions in Nigeria’s public universities fighting for quality education. “You are requested to immediately convene the meetings of your SAC to disseminate this information and to fully mobilize workers in the states for this very important protest for good governance,” parts of the letter read.
