THE United Nations Foundation is inviting applications for its Thomas Lovejoy Memorial Press Fellowship. The programme will bring a group of ten journalists to the heart of the Amazon to explore issues of biodiversity, deforestation and sustainable development. The trip will take place the week of October 17, 2022. Journalists interested in covering climate change, sustainable development, biological science and environmental issues can apply for a fellowship. Participating journalists will be expected to publish between two to four stories on the topics covered within six months of the fellowship’s conclusion. The fellowship covers roundtrip airfare, visa fees, accommodations and local travel in Brazil, along with most meals. Other expenses incurred during the trip may be eligible for reimbursement. The organiser says, “The fellowship is named after the late Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, the renowned ecologist and senior fellow for the UN Foundation who first popularised the term ‘biodiversity’.” The deadline for submission of applications is August 5, 2022.
