THE Federal Government has said it is considering a nationwide ban on the use of motorcycles, popularly known as okada. The proposed ban on okada was among the issues discussed at the National Security Council (NSC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, on Thursday. Addressing journalists after the meeting, Attorney General of Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami said investigation revealed that terrorists and bandits are using okada to launch attacks. He also disclosed that bandits use motorcycles for illegal mining activities. While the minister hinted that the meeting focused on the logistics used by terrorists and bandits, he said a nationwide ban on okada would hinder their activities and also cut off their sources of funds. Malami noted that the motorcycles are being used by the bandits for movement, while illegal mining provides them the money to purchase arms. According to him, there is need for the government to take a decisive action as terrorists and bandits had moved from the conventional ways of funding their activities to mining and ransom taking. On the implications of the ban on Nigerians, Malami said the Federal Government would place national and public interests above individual interests. Speaking on the recent attack on Kuje Correctional Center, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola disclosed that substantial efforts went into gathering of intelligence that could have prevented the attack. He expressed regrets that action was not taken on the information. Aregbesola further disclosed that the preliminary report of an investigation on the attack had been submitted to the President. The minister assured that a detailed report would be made available at the end of the probe.
