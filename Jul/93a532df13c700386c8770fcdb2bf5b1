The House pronounced the deputy governor’s impeachment after considering the panel’s recommendations. The panel was last week Thursday constituted by the Oyo State Chief Judge to investigate the allegations against Olaniyan. The state assembly started moves to impeach Olaniyan following his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The House is dominated by PDP members. The lawmakers subsequently brought allegations of financial recklessness, gross misconduct and insubordination against him. Earlier in June, Justice Ladiran Akintola of the Oyo State High Court in Ibadan ordered the State House of Assembly to suspend the impeachment moves against the Deputy Governor. The judge held that the lawmakers should maintain the status quo pending hearing the application for interlocutory injunction. However, after the lawmakers proceeded with the impeachment, Olaniyan, in an interlocutory injunction filed through his lawyer, Afolabi Fashanu (SAN), asked the court to restrain the Oyo State House of Assembly, the Speaker Adebo Ogundoyin and the Clerk from impeaching him. But the suit was dismissed by an Oyo State High Court, paving the way for Olaniyan’s impeachment.
