GOVERNORS elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have backed the selection of Kashim Shettima as the running mate of the party’s presidential candidate Bola Tinubu. The governors, after a one-hour closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at his private residence in Daura, Katsina State, on Monday, said they are confident the Tinubu-Shettima ticket will ensure victory for the party in 2023. The Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum Abubakar Bagudu, who spoke with journalists at the end of the closed-door meeting, said the two candidates are competent and will complement each other to consolidate on Buhari’s achievements. “We were pleasantly surprised when Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu announced in Daura on Sunday that Senator Kashim Ibrahim Shettima was the vice presidential candidate. “We were happy that it is no less a person than Senator Shettima who was announced the vice presidential candidate. No doubt, Senator Shettima would complement the good qualities of Asiwaju Tinubu. We are very very happy at the choice. The two will complement each other and will surely consolidate on the achievements of the President in the past seven years,” Bagudu said. Bagudu also revealed that the APC Governors Forum is working hard to win the upcoming Osun governorship election. Also speaking to journalists after the meeting, Imo State governor Hope Uzodimma added that the choice of Shettima as the vice presidential candidate was a collective decision by all the APC governors. “The choice of Senator Shettima as the vice presidential candidate is a collective decision. We shall work hard to ensure victory in all our states.” The governors at the meeting include Aminu Masari of Katsina, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano, Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi, Abubakar Bello of Niger, Hope Uzodimma of Imo, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, Simon Lalong of Plateau and Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa.
