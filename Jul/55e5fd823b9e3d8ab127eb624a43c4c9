ONE person has been injured following the collapse of a two-storey building in the Onipanu bus stop area of Lagos State. The affected building, located on Oke Arin Street, off Shyllon Street, Ilupeju, collapsed today at about 12:45 am. The Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr Oluwafemi Oke-Osanyintolu, said in his update, “Upon arrival at the incident scene, an abandoned 2-storey building collapsed to ground zero. Further investigation revealed that the incident occurred due to ageing of the structure. “Fortunately, there was no loss of life. However, one adult male sustained a minor injury and has been taken to hospital. The affected building has been cordoned off in order to prevent any threat. “Operation concluded and Cobra team heading back to base.” Two weeks ago, a church building under construction collapsed opposite Number 17, Cardoso Street, off Martins Street, in Mushin. Meanwhile, an investigation by The ICIR has revealed that the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) is yet to bring down a three-storey building at 5, Alayaki Lane, Lagos Island, which it termed distressed and had vowed to pull down on Thursday, May 26, 2022.
