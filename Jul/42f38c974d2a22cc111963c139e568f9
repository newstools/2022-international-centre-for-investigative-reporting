United States President Joe Biden is working in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19, despite being fully vaccinated and twice boosted, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday. This comes two days after President Biden tested negative for the coronavirus, even though he is said to be experiencing mild symptoms and has begun taking Paxlovid. “Consistent with CDC guidelines, he will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,” Jean-Pierre said in a statement. The President will work in isolation until he tests negative again, before returning to in-person work. “Out of an abundance of transparency, the White House will provide a daily update on the President’s status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation,” the statement added. Per standard protocol for any positive case at the White House, the White House Medical Unit has informed all close contacts of the President of the development, including any members of Congress and any members of the press who interacted with him during Wednesday’s travel. Biden was in Massachusetts on Wednesday to deliver remarks on “tackling the climate crisis and seizing the opportunity of a clean energy future to create jobs and lower costs for families”. The White House also confirmed that Vice President Kamala Harris, who was last with the President on Tuesday, tested negative.
