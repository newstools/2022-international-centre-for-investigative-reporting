THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has assured Nigerians that this year’s Sallah would be the last they would celebrate in an “atmosphere of doom and gloom.” The PDP national chairman,  Iyorchia Ayu, gave the assurance today while felicitating Nigerians on this year’s Eid-el-Kabir. Ayu praised Nigerians, saying they did not let the economic uncertainties dampen their celebrations. “Many things are not right with our people and the beloved nation as we celebrate this year’s Sallah holiday. Still, we celebrate and give thanks to God because our faith is stronger than our fears. “Nigeria has never had it so bad. But we refuse to let fear kill our joy. We are Nigerians. We don’t give up. We believe the darkest hour comes before dawn,” he said. The PDP leader added that Nigerians were holding forth despite what he called the calamities and insecurity troubling them as citizen. He said, “We may not have money to slaughter rams and we may not afford the bare necessities of life, still, we celebrate. Our faith in God’s benevolence remains unshaken and unshakable.” Ayu noted that the spirit of Eid-el-Kabir was in the sacrifice, love, selflessness, piety and faith as exemplified by the prophet in the holy Quran. He urged the Muslim Umaa not to lose sight of these virtues as they celebrate and pray for Nigeria.
