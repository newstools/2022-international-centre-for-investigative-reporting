THE Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL) has urged the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to prosecute looters of COVID-19 intervention funds and palliatives. ICPC Chairman Bolaji Owasanoye disclosed at the 2022 African Union (AU) Anti-Corruption Day in Abuja that relevant ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government would be investigated over the infractions observed in the procurement and payments made after the release and disbursement of COVID-19 funds. Owasanoye added that reports indicated favouritism in the allocation and distribution of palliatives by political actors and their affiliates. CACOL Chairman Debo Adeniran said in a statement on Friday that the body had called on relevant anti-graft agencies to scrutinize the disbursement of funds at the height of the pandemic. Adeniran noted that millions of Nigerians who were living below the poverty line were denied the palliatives. He said, “Hence, it was so strange to notice the abysmal strategies adopted by agencies of government in the distribution of palliatives and spending of the intervention fund. “We cannot forget the rate of hoarding and diversion of palliatives that led to the raids of facilities warehousing palliatives by impoverished people in different parts of the country.” Adeniran added, “We at CACOL are happy that the ICPC is beaming its searchlight on these erring agencies, though it is coming a bit late but it is better late than never. “We hope the anti-graft agency would carry out a thorough investigation of the agencies concerned and if found wanting, the officials involved should be made to face the full wrath of the law”.
