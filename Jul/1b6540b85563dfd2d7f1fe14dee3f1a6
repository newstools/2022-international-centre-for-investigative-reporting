DAVID Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, has urged voters to be vigilant ahead of the sorting and counting of votes in the Osun State governorship election. Davido, who is a nephew to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Ademola Adeleke, made the call via his Twitter handle on Saturday. He tweeted: “Remember this is the critical period !! It was this time 4 years ago. Around 1 pm that they started their mischief. Everyone be vigilant. Come out and vote and defend your votes until the end!! Be alert ! We have waited 4 years for this moment !!” READ ALSO: Osun election: ASUU strike blamed for low turnout at OAU polling units Osun Decides 2022: Old video of Iyiola Omisore sharing money resurfaces online Osun election: APP candidate accuses PDP of hijacking party’s agents Osun guber poll: Vote-buying recorded as party agents offer money to voters It would be recalled that the Osun State governorship election of 2018, where Adeleke was also the PDP candidate, was declared inclusive before All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate Gboyega Oyetola was later declared the winner after a rerun. Adeleke and the PDP rejected the result declared by INEC, alleging that the election was rigged. The PDP candidate alleged that voters were deliberately refused access to polling units at gun point while those at the voting centres were intimidated to vote for the APC. However, efforts by Adeleke and the PDP to overturn the result were not successful. Davido has been campaigning for Adeleke and participated in the PDP grand rally in Osogbo on Thursday.
