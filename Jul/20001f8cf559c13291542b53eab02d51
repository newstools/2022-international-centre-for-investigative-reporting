THE presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has called on the Federal government to apprehend the attackers of the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Tinubu made the call today in Abuja in a statement issued by his Media Officer, Tunde Rahman. “Tuesday’s terror attack on Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre is worrisome. These incessant attacks on government’s institutions and innocent citizens are a sad reminder that we still have a lot to do to put these evil forces in check. “I totally condemn this dastardly attack. The government must immediately go after the attackers and fleeing inmates of this facility. “While also calling for full investigation of the incident and the possible failure to act on intelligence, we must all remain vigilant and united. This moment calls for national unity and deep introspection,” he said Tinubu commiserated with the families and relations of victims who died during the attack, and urged citizens to remain supportive of the present administration and its fight against terrorism. The Kuje Medium Correctional Facility had been attacked by gunmen on the night of Tuesday, July 5, 2022. The gunmen invaded the facility with sophisticated explosives, which defied initial attempts by the prison security to repel the attack. Over 800 out of about 1000 inmates at the facility had escaped, though authorities said half of the escapees were now in custody. All Boko Haram suspects in the facility had fled, and members of the Islamic State of West Africa Province released a short video on Wednesday night, claiming responsibility for the attack.
