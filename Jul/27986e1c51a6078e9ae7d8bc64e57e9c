THE Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) Kwara Command has rearrested a kidnap suspect, Bodo Abdullahi, in Ilorin, the state capital. According to the Command’s spokesperson Olasunkanmi Ayeni, Bodo was arrested for alleged kidnapping and murder. The NSCDC said members of Bodo’s kidnap gang had kidnapped an 80-year-old man, Alhaji Abba, in Eruwa, Oyo State, collected ransom and later killed the victim. “The crime was committed in Eruwa, Oyo, while the suspect was arrested at Banni community in the Kaiama local government area of Kwara state at the weekend.,” Ayeni said. “Three of the suspects were arrested for kidnapping by the police. The victim was kidnapped, and ransom was demanded from family members and was paid. However, the victim was later killed. “Three of the suspects were arrested, while the other two absconded. However, men of the NSCDC nabbed one of them, Bodo Musa Alhaji, at Banni division in the Kaiama local government area of Kwara State out of shared information by members of the public and sister security agencies. All other details like the ransom and other arrested suspects are with the police in Oyo State,” he added. Ayeni described the suspect as an ex-convict and said he would be transferred to the NSCDC’s office in Ibadan, Oyo State, for further investigation and prosecution.
