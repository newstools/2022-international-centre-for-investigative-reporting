BORNO State Governor Babagana Zulum has offered a N5 million scholarship to a 13-year-old boy, Musa Sani, for copy-designing the state’s first flyover bridge in Maiduguri, the state capital, with mud. Zulum visited the boy’s family in Maiduguri, the state capital, and offered him the scholarship. The scholarship will help the boy from primary four until he completes secondary school. The government has paid the scholarship fund to Golden Olive Academy, a private school in Maiduguri, and enrolled the boy in the school. A statement obtained by The ICIR on the governor’s Facebook page on Monday said Zulum was “amazed by the kid’s brilliance”. Musa was born into a poor family living around the Gwange area in Maiduguri, where he had schooled until he caught Zulum’s attention. President Muhammadu Buhari commissioned the flyover bridge in December 2021. “The Governor directed the Borno State Education Trust Fund (ETF) to fund the boy’s education. “Chairperson of ETF Prof. Hauwa Biu, presented a cheque of five million and twenty-nine thousand Naira (N5,029,000), with the fund already paid to a private school at which Musa is now schooling. “Prof Biu thanked Governor Zulum for the offer and urged the boy to focus on his studies and make the governor proud,” the statement said. Below are the pictures of Sani’s works that won Governor Zulum’s heart.
