INSPECTOR-General of Police Usman Baba has deployed 21,000 policemen for Saturday’s governorship election in Osun State. Baba revealed this on Tuesday at a stakeholders’ meeting organised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Osogbo, Osun State capital. Noting the the policemen are not out to intimidate law-abiding citizens, the IGP urged eligible voters to go out and exercise their franchise without fear. According to him, the 332 wards of the 30 local government areas in the state would be well-secured. While issuing a strong warning to those who plan to disrupt the polls, Baba noted that the police would arrest and prosecute anyone found wanting throughout the period of the exercise. Osun State INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Abdulganiy Raji also gave an update on preparations for the election. He revealed that polling units have been moved away from controversial areas such as the front of politicians’ houses, palaces and religious centres, to open spaces and public buildings. “This action is to ensure adequate security and peaceful elections. Flashpoints have been identified and strategies (have been) mapped out to resolve issues that can truncate the election process,” he said. The REC also hinted at the conversion of voting points to polling units in a bid to ensure the expansion of voter access during the election. He confirmed that all non-sensitive materials to be used in Saturday’s election have been batched to the polling unit level and ready to be conveyed to the various Registration Area Centres (RACs). Raji further disclosed that polling officials are ready for deployment.
