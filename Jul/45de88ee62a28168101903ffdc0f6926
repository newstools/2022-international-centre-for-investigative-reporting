If elected President, Adebanjo said Obi would “rule independently without the influence of these criminals in the government”. “Tinubu will only give continuity to Buhari’s incompetence. “We know Peter Obi very well, that’s why we endorsed him. He will not disappoint Nigerians, let’s put tribal differences apart and vote the right leader in,” he added. Also, in a separate interview with Vanguard, Adebanjo, said the decision to support Obi was based on equity and fairness, adding that it will bring about peace in the country. “Yes we have endorsed Peter Obi. My reason for supporting him is because, based on equity and justice, the Presidency should go to the South-East. That is what I have been saying. I have not changed my position on that. If you want peace and tranquillity in this country; if you want the country to be united, we must do the right thing by ensuring the Presidency goes to the South-East. I have no reason to change my stand,” he noted.
