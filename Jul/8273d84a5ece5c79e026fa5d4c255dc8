MINISTER of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) Muhammad Musa Bello has called on traditional rulers in the area councils to work with security operatives in apprehending inmates who escaped from the Kuje Prison. Bello made the call during a visit to the prison on Wednesday A statement by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) said the minister described the incident as sad and unfortunate, and urged community members to provide security agencies with relevant information which would lead to the re-arrest of the escapees. “While calling on members of the communities to provide appropriate intelligence to the security agencies to enable them do their work, the minister expressed confidence that, with maximum cooperation from the communities, all those who escaped would be traced, found and brought back since no one could go into any community and blend without being spotted by members of the community,” the statement said. Bello also met with the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS) Haliru Nababa and the Gomo of Kuje during the visit. Noting that the incident was a threat to everyone, the minister said efforts are being made to strengthen security around the facility and other parts of the FCT. “Mallam Bello expressed his condolences to the Gomo of Kuje, and sympathised with the family of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps officer who lost his life during the incident, describing him as a very fine and gallant officer,” the statement added. Gunmen attacked the Kuje Prison, in the Kuje area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), on Tuesday night. The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) said at least five persons died in the attack, while over 879 inmates escaped. The NCoS, however, noted that over 400 inmates have since been re-arrested.
