The Niger State Command of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has ordered a 24-hour surveillance of the four hydroelectric power stations in the state. The commandant of the NSCDC in the state, Ahmed Mohammed Dandare, gave the order in a meeting with the 25 divisional officers and six area commandants in Minna. With an emphasis on the power stations in Shiroro, Kanji, Jebba, and Zungeru, Dandare directed the officers to secure all critical national assets in the state. While he cautioned the officers not to lose guard and be vigilant in their operational areas, he urged them to be wary of surprise attacks, like the recent one in the Shiroro local government area, and to shun bribery. “I am appealing to all the divisional offices to adhere strictly to the rule of engagement, as any officer found wanting in the discharge of his duty shall be dealt with severely,” Dandare warned.
