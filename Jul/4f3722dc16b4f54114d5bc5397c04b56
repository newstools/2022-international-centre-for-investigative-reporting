A High Court sitting in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has ordered that a former Accountant-General of the Federation (AGF) Ahmed Idris, be remanded in the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre. Justice Adeyemi Ajayi gave the order when Idris was arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Friday. The former AGF was arraigned on a 14-count charge bordering on criminal breach of trust and money laundering. Idris will remain in the Kuje Prison pending the determination of his bail application. The case was adjourned till July 27, for hearing of the bail application. Idris was arrested by the EFCC in May, while he was still serving as Accountant General of the Federation, over an alleged N84 billion fraud. The EFCC said he committed the fraud through bogus consultancies and other illegal activities, using family members and close associates. Idris was also accused of laundering the stolen money through real estate investments in Kano and Abuja. In the 14-count charge filed against Idris, the EFCC disclosed that he collected N15 bribe to facilitate the payment of 13 per cent derivative fund to nine oil producing states.
