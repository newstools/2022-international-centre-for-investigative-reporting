SAUDI Arabia has opened its air space to all air carriers. The Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) in a tweet said the move was to prevent non-discrimination of civil aircraft while connecting the Kingdom to the world. It read, “The General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) announces the decision to open the Kingdom’s airspace for all air carriers that meet the requirements of the Authority for overflying.” “Within the framework of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s keenness to fulfill its obligations under the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates non-discrimination between civil aircraft used in international air navigation, and to complement the efforts aimed at consolidating the Kingdom’s position as a global hub connecting three continents,” it added. This move was welcomed by United States National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. He said, “President Biden welcomes and commends the historic decision by the leadership of Saudi Arabia to open Saudi airspace to all civilian carriers without discrimination, a decision that includes flights to and from Israel,” he stated. Before now, the Arab nation lifted the ban on flights from Nigeria as well as 16 other countries on March 6, 2022. Other countries are South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, Malawi, Mauritius, Zambia, Madagascar, Angola, Seychelles, United Republic of Comoros, Ethiopia and Afghanistan. Similarly, the Arab nation put an end to social distancing in the two holy mosques in the Kingdom but insisted on face masks while accessing the place of worship.
