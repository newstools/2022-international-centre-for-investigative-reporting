A FEDERAL High Court in Abuja has disqualified the Delta State Peoples Democracy Party (PDP) candidate for the 2023 governorship election Sheriff Oborevwori over an allegation of certificate forgery. Justice Taiwo Taiwo, in a judgment on Thursday, stated that Oborevwori was ineligible to contest the gubernatorial primary due to discrepancies in his certificates. Oborevwori was declared the winner of the PDP governorship primary in Delta State. He scored 590 votes ahead of David Edevbie, who polled 113 votes. However, Edevbie dragged Oborevwori to court over alleged discrepancies in his certificates. The court, in Thursday’s ruling, also restrained Oborevwori, who is the Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly and anointed candidate of the state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, from parading himself as the candidate of the PDP.
