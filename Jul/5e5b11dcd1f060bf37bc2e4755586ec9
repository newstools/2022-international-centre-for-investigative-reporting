PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has said he would leave no stone unturned in solving the difficulties Nigerians are facing. The President said this on Friday in his message to Nigerians to mark the Eid-el-Kabir celebration. Buhari, who is currently in his hometown, Daura, Katsina state, for the celebration, said he was aware of the difficulties the people were facing. According to a statement signed by the presidential spokesperson, Garba Shehu, Buhari said efforts were ongoing to resolve the hardship confronting the people. The President also urged Nigerians to put the  interest of the country above every other interest. He said, “If we are putting the teachings of our religions into practice, most of the evils afflicting our society would have been solved. Use religion as a motivation for the love of our common humanity.” He added that the people shouldn’t use religion as a mere badge of identity, but as a motivator for doing good for the country. “The exploitation of the people by traders and the stealing of public funds by civil servants and other holders of public trust are a reflection of the abandonment of the teachings of our religions. “Our society is a bundle of contradictions. People display external religiosity without fear of God; they make life difficult for others; money becomes their god; leaders abandon their oaths of office by taking money meant for the welfare of the people and divert it to their private pockets,” Buhari said. He called on the citizens to use the Sallah period to show love and care to their neighbours and others, saying it was a spiritually important event in life.
