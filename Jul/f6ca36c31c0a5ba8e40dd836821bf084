A FORMER Minister of Education Obiageli Ezekwesili has faulted the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for using her picture in an online post she claims is false and extremely misleading. In a post on its verified Twitter page, the PDP paraded pictures of Ezekwesili and other appointees that worked under former President Olusegun Obasanjo and attributed their success to its presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, who was vice president in the administration. But reacting to the claim in a tweet, Ezekwesili said it was false and faulted the PDP for using her picture without her consent.  “It might be an innocent mistake, but this statement is false and therefore extremely misleading, “He was not. It is also wrong that you have used my picture in your campaign flier without my consent. Please do kindly remove this immediately. Many thanks!,” she tweeted. Other people whose images were also in the PDP tweet are Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Director General of World Trade Organisation (WTO), Anambra State governor, Chukwuma Soludo and Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai. Ezekwesili was Minister of Education from 2006 to 2007 and Minister of Solid Minerals Development between 2005–2006 during the Obasanjo administration.
