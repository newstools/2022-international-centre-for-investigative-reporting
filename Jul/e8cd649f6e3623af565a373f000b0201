THE Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has concluded plans to shut down flight operations on runway 18L/36R for 90 days. A statement signed by its acting general manager, Corporate Affairs, Faithful Hope-Ivbaze, said the closure of the runway would help the authority complete the installation of CAT III Airfield Ground Lighting system on the runway. The project is expected to commence on Friday, July 8, 2022. The statement noted there would be no flight disruption despite the temporary closure and all normal flight operations would be conducted through the runway. “A Notice to Air Missions ( NOTAMs ) to this effect has already been published and disseminated accordingly,” the statement read in part. On February 10, 2021, FAAN had closed the same runway temporarily after a landing incident occurred, involving a Boeing 737 Azman Air aircraft with registration 5N SYS and flight number ZQ2325. Apparently, the plane’s tyre had burst after landing on the runway. Similarly, the aviation authorities conducted rehabilitation works on the runway from May 28 to May 29, 2022 between 0600 and 1300hours, days after a mangled body was found on the road stretch. The runway was also closed on June 4 and June 5, 2022.
