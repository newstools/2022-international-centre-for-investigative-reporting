OSUN State governor-elect Ademola Adeleke has warned his supporters to desist from unruly celebrations over his victory in Saturday’s governorship election or risk being disowned as members of his political family. Adeleke, in a statement released by his spokesperson Olawale Rasheed, on Sunday, condemned reported violent conduct of some youths celebrating his victory. He also dissociated himself and his political organisation from such activities. The statement said: “It has come to the attention of the Governor-Elect that some youths are engaging in violent celebrations, leading to isolated attacks on vehicles and even individuals. “This is an unacceptable conduct and those involved in such behaviour are warned to stop forthwith.” Some persons have reportedly injured themselves in the process of celebrating Adeleke’s victory in the governorship election. Adeleke, while commiserating with the said victims, explained that his campaign organisation did not authorise such celebrations. According to him, those involved in such incidents are not part of his team.
