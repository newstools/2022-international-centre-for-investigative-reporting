Gunmen attacked the Kuje Prison, in the Kuje area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), on Tuesday night. The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) said at least five persons died in the attack, while over 879 inmates escaped.  The NCoS further disclosed that an official of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) attached to the prison was killed, adding that three of its officials were badly injured. The NCoS, however, noted that over 400 inmates have since been re-arrested. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, FCT Minister Muhammad Musa Bello and many others have condemned the attack. Buhari, during a visit to the prison on Wednesday, expressed disappointment with the intelligence system at the correctional facility. “I am disappointed with the intelligence system. How can terrorists organise, have weapons, attack a security installation and get away with it?” he asked. The FCT Minister, on his part, urged traditional rulers to work with security operatives to fish out fleeing inmates who may be hiding within their communities.
