United Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Boris Johnson has bowed to pressure to stand down as Conservative Party leader. Johnson intended to carry on as Prime Minister until the autumn when a replacement is elected but latest developments on Thursday indicate he is set to resign. This follows a dramatic 48-hours which saw dozens of ministers, including chancellor Rishi Sunak, resigning in protest at his leadership style.

Despite allegations of sexual misconduct levelled against Pincher, John had elevated him to the position of power as the party’s deputy chief whip. There were initial claims that the PM was not aware of allegations of misconduct against Pincher before appointing him as deputy chief whip, but reports emerged later that Johnson was not just informed, but was also personally briefed about it. On Tuesday, Johnson admitted he was informed about the complaint in 2019 and apologised for appointing Pincher to the government role. Johnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis, but gave in on Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up. The leader of the opposition Labour Party Keir Starmer, said it was “good news for the country” that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that “it should have happened long ago.” “He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,” said Starmer on Twitter. Johnson is expected to make a statement to the country today, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
