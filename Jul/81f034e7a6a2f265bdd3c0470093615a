GOVERNOR of Zamfara State Bello Matawalle has issued a directive that prohibits traditional rulers in the state from awarding chieftaincy titles without authorisation. The directive was announced in a statement released by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Public Enlightenment, Media and Communications, Zailani Bappa on Wednesday, June 20. According to the statement, “All Emirs, Senior District Heads and District Heads in the state are hereby directed to officially seek permission from the State Government before conferring traditional titles to anyone. “The directive becomes necessary in order to check indiscriminate award and possible abuse of the traditional institution. “Henceforth, no Emir, Senior District Head or District Head must appoint anybody into any traditional office without securing official permission and clearance from the state Government.” The statement warned that failure to comply with the directive will attract serious reprimand from the state government. The ICIR reported that the state government suspended the Emir of Benin Yandoto, Aliyu Garba Marafa, for turbanning a notorious bandit leader, Ado Aliero, as Sarkin Fulani. Aliero was turbaned as a leader of the Fulani by the Emir on Saturday. The development was widely condemned by Nigerians.
