A Federal High Court in Abuja has granted permission to former Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha, to travel abroad for medical attention. Justice Inyang Ekwo, who granted the permission, ordered the registrar of the Court to release the travelling passport of the former governor to him to undertake the medical trip. The order is sequel to an application by Ola Olanipekun, SAN, who notified the court that his client has been having health challenges recently. Olanipekun said Okorocha, the Senator representing Imo North in the Senate, would not abuse the order and would return to the country for his trial. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), represented by Chile Okoroma, had sought to oppose the request, but the agency later backed down when Justice Ekwo explained that the proposal would be granted with a caveat by the court. While granting the request, the judge ordered Okorocha to return the passport to the court registrar within three days of his arrival in the country. The judge held that he would declare Okorocha wanted if he attempted to abuse the favour granted him. Meanwhile, the court has fixed November 7 trial in the money laundering and criminal charges brought against Okorocha by the Federal Government.
