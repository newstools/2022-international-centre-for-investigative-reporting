RIVERS State Governor Nyesom Wike on Friday met three All Progressives Congress (APC) governors at his private residence in Port Harcourt. The governors are Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State and Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State. A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, former governor of Ekiti State Ayo Fayose, was also at the meeting. The details of the closed-door meeting are not yet known but it may not be unconnected with the 2023 presidential election. Wike, one of the leaders of the PDP, is expected to back his party’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar, but there are speculations that the Rivers State Governor is unhappy after he was not selected as the vice presidential candidate. In the same vein, despite Atiku’s emergence as PDP presidential candidate, Fayose recently declared that the South must produce Nigeria’s President in 2023. Like Wike, Fayose contested the presidential primary of the PDP but lost to former Vice President Atiku. In a post on Twitter on June 29, Fayose insisted that power must rotate to the South in 2023. “The PDP Constitution provides for a rotational Presidency. Section 3(c) provides that the Party shall pursue its aims and objectives by adhering to the policy of the rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness. “The current President of Nigeria is a two-term Northern Presidency, thus implying that it MUST be a Southern Presidency in 2023 or NOTHING,” Fayose said.
