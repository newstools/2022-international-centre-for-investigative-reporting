ONLY two per cent of all inmates in Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) facilities nationwide are female. Data obtained from the website of the NCoS showed 74,675 inmates across its facilities as of July 4. Of the figure, 1,536 were female, and 73,139 were male. The NCoS said 21,961 inmates had been convicted, and 52,714 were awaiting trial. Convicted males were 21,559, and females serving jail terms were 402. In percentage, 29 per cent of inmates were convicts, and 71 per cent were awaiting trial. There were 51,580 males, and 1,134 females awaiting trial, respectively. Multiple reports have revealed the level of congestion in correctional facilities. Meanwhile, under President Muhammadu Buhari’s watch, there have been twelve prison breaks in the past five years, with over 3,400 fleeing inmates, according to the Punch. The latest jailbreak was at the Medium Correctional Centre, Kuje, which came under attack on July 5. According to the government, 879 inmates, including all the Boko Haram suspects, escaped from the facility. Here is the list of the fleeing inmates. The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) claimed responsibility for the attack. The Nigerian government, however, said the terrorists came with superior weapons, which helped them subdue the security forces guarding the facility.
