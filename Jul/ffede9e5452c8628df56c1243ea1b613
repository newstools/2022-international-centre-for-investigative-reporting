LOW voters turnout was recorded at polling units in Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) campus, Ile-Ife, during the Osun State governorship election on Saturday. There are 10 polling units in the university premises. However, despite the large number of registered voters, few persons turned out at the polling units.

In an interview, Vice President of the OAU Students Union Government Aworanti Salvation expressed sadness that students were encouraged to get their voter cards and participate in the electioneering process, but eventually they couldn’t vote because of the ongoing strike. “We organised awareness drives for students to get their permanent voter cards but it’s so painful that the government is responsible for the disenfranchisement of the majority of students. A lot of students have their voter cards but have been deprived of the opportunity of exercising their constitutional right.” She added, “OAU has more than 30,000 students and about 10,000 students who live on campus. However, less than five per cent of registered voters on OAU campus were able to participate in today’s election, as many students have been home since the commencement of the strike.”  So far, the election has been peaceful and sorting and counting have commenced at the polling units.
