THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has issued a Certificate of Return to Osun State governor-elect Ademola Adeleke. Adeleke received the certificate at the INEC office in Osogbo, Osun State capital, on Wednesday. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate on Saturday polled 403,371 votes to defeat other contestants, including the incumbent, All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate Governor Gboyega Oyetola, in the governorship election. A Nigerian musician David Adeleke, who is a nephew to the governor-elect, had earlier raised the alarm after INEC failed to issue the Certificate of Return to Adeleke, 48 hours after the election. However, INEC, in a statement by its National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, faulted Davido’s comments. The Commission said it has up to 14 days to issue the winner of the election with the certificate. In his acceptance speech after receiving the certificate, Adeleke dedicated his victory in the election to the memory of his late elder brother, Isiaka Adeleke, and the people of Osun State.
