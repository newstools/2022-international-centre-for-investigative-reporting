A UNITED Kingdom (UK) magistrate court in Westminster will today decide whether or not the trial of a former Nigerian Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice, will continue under the country’s legal system. The Ekweremadus were arrested and charged for bringing a child to the country for organ harvesting, a potential offence under modern slavery legislation in the UK.
