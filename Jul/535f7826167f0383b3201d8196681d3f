THE Ekiti State Police Command on Monday said it arrested three suspected kidnappers who have been terrorising residents of the state. Spokesman of the Command Sunday Abutu disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists. The suspects were identified as Abdullahi Musa (38), Abdullahi Ali (25) and Abdullahi Suleiman (19). Abutu noted that the culprits were trailed and arrested inside a deep forest in Ijan-Ekiti, Gbonyin Local Government Area of the state by operatives of the Command’s Rapid Response Squad in collaboration with a vigilante group. The development, the statement said, was in line with the Command’s determination to rid the state of kidnappers and other criminal elements. The police spokesman further disclosed that during interrogation, the suspects confessed to have engaged in series of kidnapping operations in Ekiti State, including two abductions in Ikere-Ekiti. “The suspects further disclosed their syndicate comprises seven (7) men with four others currently at large. Effort is ongoing for the possible arrest of the fleeing suspects,” Abutu stated. The arrest of the suspects is coming barely two weeks after a similar arrest was made in the Ido Local Government Area of the state.
