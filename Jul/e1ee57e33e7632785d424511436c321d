Nigeria’s electricity grid has once again collapsed, crashing today to zero megawatts (mw) 38 days after the last one on June 12  2022. The latest collapse happened 20 days after the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) facilitated a contract-based performance agreement with distribution companies (DisCos) to optimise power supply to Nigerians by guaranteeing 5000 mw of power.

We are in talks with the Transmission Company of Nigeria to ascertain the cause of the collapse and a possible restoration timeline.” The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) is yet to issue any official statement to the effect, despite confirmation by the DisCos.
