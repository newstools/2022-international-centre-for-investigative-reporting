Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, disclosed these in a statement released late on Tuesday night. The statement was titled ‘Gallant Presidential Guards Repel Attack on Advance Team Ahead of President’s Visit’. The Presidency described the shooting near Dutsinma as “sad and unwelcome.” “The attackers opened fire on the convoy from ambush positions but were repelled by the military, police and DSS personnel accompanying the convoy. “Two persons in the convoy are receiving treatment for the minor injuries they suffered. All the other personnel, staff and vehicles made it safely to Daura.” The attack came less than a week after terrorists ambushed and killed over 40 soldiers and policemen who responded to a distress call when their killers pounced on expatriate and local miners around Shiroro, a community in Niger State, last Thursday. In addition to killing the officers and other locals, the gunmen whisked away undisclosed number of the miners.
