CANDIDATE of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Osun State governorship election Ademola Adeleke has explained why he jumped the queue to cast his ballot at his polling unit. Adeleke reportedly cast his vote ahead of people he met in the queue when he arrived at the polling unit. Justifying his action while responding to questions from journalists after casting his vote at Unit 009, Ward 02, Abogunde/Sagba, Ede North, Adeleke said the people loved him and that was why they allowed him to vote ahead of them. “It was the people that invited me to come forward and cast my ballot. They asked me to step forward and go the front.” Asked if that is how he will continue without “regard for the common man” if he is elected as governor, he said, “You can see me; I love my people. And that will not stop when elected.” On the election process and the Independent National Electoral Commission’s preparedness for the poll, he said the process was “fantastic”. He said from the feelers he was getting across the state, calmness was the order of the day and he expects the situation to remain the same. Speaking on rumoured vote-buying by political opponents, he expressed hope that the reports are just rumours. “We want this election to be a point of contact for 2023. The whole world is watching us and this is going to be a test for us all. So, let Osun people decide who they want,” he said.
