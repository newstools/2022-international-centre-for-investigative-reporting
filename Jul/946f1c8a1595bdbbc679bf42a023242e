Residents of the Ifofin area, Ilesha East Local Government Area, are becoming apprehensive after waiting a long time for the appearance of the Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola. Voters at the minister’s polling unit told The ICIR that they are eagerly waiting for the arrival of Aregbesola at his polling unit, PU 001, Ward 8 in Ifofin, Ilesha East. A voter Temitope Ajetunmobi said even though most of them have voted, they are only waiting to catch a glimpse of the former governor of the state. ” We are waiting to see Aregbe. I have voted since. Some of these people here have also voted, but we are just waiting to see Aregbesola. He always votes here; he doesn’t miss it,” he said. However, as of 11:15 am, the minister has not shown up. A situation the residents find strange. Aregbesola has been at loggerheads with the incumbent governor and All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate Gboyega Oyetola. Oyetola is also contesting for a second term in office.
