FOLLOWING the impeachment of Oyo State Deputy Governor Rauf Olaniyan on Monday, the state assembly has approved the nomination of Bayo Lawal as his replacement. The development came shortly after the Speaker of the House of Assembly Adebo Ogundoyin read a letter from the state governor Seyi Makinde seeking the lawmakers’ approval of Lawal’s nomination as the new deputy governor. The lawmakers had impeached Olaniyan following the recommendation of a seven-man panel set up by the state Chief Judge Munta Abimbola. The panel recommended Olaniyan for removal over allegations of gross misconduct. Before his nomination as deputy governor, Lawal was Chairman of Oyo State Water Corporation. He had earlier been nominated as Makinde’s running mate for the 2023 governorship election. Makinde will be seeking a second term as governor in the election.
