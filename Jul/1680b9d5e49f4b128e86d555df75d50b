THE Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Wednesday distanced itself from some bishops sighted at the unveiling of the vice presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Kashim Shettima. Vice President of CAN (Northern States and Abuja) and chairman of the Kaduna State Chapter Joseph John Hayab disowned the bishops in an interview with journalists in Abuja. Hayab also accused APC presidential candidate Bola Tinubu of desperation and urged him to do the “right thing and stop the drama.” READ ALSO: Borno CAN chairman debunks applauding Shettima’s selection as Tinubu’s running mate 2023: Chris Okotie urges presidential candidates to step down for him Shettima speaks on Muslim-Muslim ticket, says it’s a Nigerian project According to him, the APC flagbearer was free to “hire mechanics and other artisans and sew clerical garments for them”. The CAN vice president added, “The people we saw at the unveiling of Shettima paraded as bishops are people who did not have enough time to learn how to wear bishop garments. Take a closer look at their photo and you will see another Nollywood movie. “CAN wonders why the desperation. First, a story was out claiming to have come from the chairman of CAN Borno State only to be refuted. Secondly, there was another lie that BAT (Bola Ahmed Tinubu) and his running mate were on their way to meet CAN President one night. A meeting that was not true and was on a night that the CAN President was in Alabama USA attending the Baptist World Alliance Conference of which he is the Vice President. “Another desperation story was that they met Papa Adeboye which the RCCG later refuted. If Christians are not important why the desperation?” Noting that CAN appreciates that Nigeria practices democracy, Hayab said there was no need to do funny and dubious things just to prove a point “because it will in the end bounce back”.
