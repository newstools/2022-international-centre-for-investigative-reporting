UNITED Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Boris Johnson resigned Thursday, following the resignation of over 60 ministers protesting his leadership. The relentless stream of resignations was dramatically kickstarted by Finance Minister Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid.

Speaking outside Downing Street, Johnson said the process for choosing the new leader of the Conservative Party should begin now, with a timetable to be announced next week. “At Westminster, the herd instinct is powerful and when the herd moves, it moves. Sad to be giving up the best job in the world,” Johnson said but conceded that “no one is remotely indispensable”. The Prime Minister, however, said he intends to remain in place until a new Tory leader is elected. His decision to remain in office comes despite a clear lack of support from within his own party and a growing push across the political spectrum for him to step down immediately. Anger had been widespread in the Tory Party ever since the first revelations of the Prime Minister hosting parties during the lockdown, including his birthday party event in June 2020 that saw the police fine him £50. Last month, the Prime Minister appeared to secure his short-term political survival as he received 211 votes in a confidence ballot among Tory MPs, with 148 voting against his leadership.
