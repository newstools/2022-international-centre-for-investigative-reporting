AGENTS of political parties involved in the Osun State governorship election have protested after security agents, including operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS), prevented them from inspecting the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines. Party agents at PU 010, Ward 4, Unit 10 Alajuewa, insisted they have the right to check the functionality of the device. However they were prevented from doing so by the security agents. The decision of the security operatives resulted in rowdy scenes as the party agents raised their voices in protest. The agents were later asked to maintain some distance away from the polling booths as they carry out their oversight functions. However, The ICIR observed that the BVAS machines have been working properly in polling units except in some places where the devices temporarily failed. As of the time of filing this report, the electioneering process has been peaceful in most of the polling units visited by The ICIR’s reporters.
