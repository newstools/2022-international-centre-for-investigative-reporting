AS voting exercise continues in the Osun State Glgovernorship election, officials of the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Saturday laid siege at the polling unit of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate Ademola Adeleke. The ICIR counted about 10 of the officials who came via a white Toyota Haice Bus with Abuja plate number BWR 651 GA. They patrolled round the PU in search for possible activities that could breach the electoral process such as violence, vote buying and the likes. The ICIR approached one of the officials to find out how many persons have been arrested for vote buying but he merely said “That’s not our mission here,” and left. Earlier, Adeleke voted at about 8:45 am at the Sagba/Abogunde Ward 2, Polling Unit 9, Ede North Local Government Area. He described the election as peaceful, turnout as impressive as of the period, and commended the electoral umpire, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). “INEC has improved and they have been fantastic,” he said. While the former Senator discarded the case of vote buying, independent findings showed names are being compiled secretly. One man identified as Fatai was the coordinator. He was sighted appealing to those who have written their names waiting to be paid. “We cannot disburse anything now. The EFCC is around,” Fatai who was in a brown faded suit and navy blue joggers said. One of the female voters who had walked up to Fatai to demand for cash is Opeyemi Kareem. With a baby strapped behind her, she appealed not to be shortchanged as she was leaving to take care of the child. The EFCC later left the PU at about 10:51 pm. Other security agencies present are the police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and Department of State Security (DSS).
