THE Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye has lauded the conduct of the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) in the ongoing gubernatorial election in the state. The Speaker, who made the remarks after casting his vote at PU 06, Ward 10, Ilesa East, Osun East, at exactly 10.02 am, said the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) would enhance transparency of the voting process. “The process of using BVAS was seamless for me, and I believe it would validate the credibility of the elections. “Once you are able to tell the election officer your number from the notice board, it becomes easier to cast your vote. That’s how I did it,” he said. The Speaker further urged the people to remain calm and believe in the process. “This is the critical period for the people of Osun to elect their leaders, those who are not out yet should come out and cast their votes.”
