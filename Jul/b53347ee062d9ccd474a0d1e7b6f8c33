CANDIDATE of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the ongoing governorship election in Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola, voted a few minutes after arriving at the polling unit. The incumbent governor voted at Ward 2, Unit 1, located at Popo Primary School, Boripe Local Government Area, Iragbiji, Osun State. Oyetola voted around 11:30 pm after arriving about 30 minutes earlier. The APC candidate has earlier called for a peaceful election process. “My good people of Osun, as we go to the polls today, let us go about it peacefully. Let us eschew violence, brigandage, disorderliness or anything that could disrupt the peaceful atmosphere we all have been enjoying in the state. “As stakeholders, it is our responsibility to ensure that Osun maintains its status as the most peaceful state in Nigeria. “Let me in particular, appeal to members and supporters of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) to exercise their civic rights peacefully,” Oyetola said in a message posted on Twitter. Oyetola’s arch rival, Ademola Adeleke, voted earlier in the morning. Adeleke voted at Polling Unit 009, Ward 02, Abogunde/Sagba, Ede North, at about 9:00 am. The election is taking place in 246 polling units across the 30 local government areas in the state.
