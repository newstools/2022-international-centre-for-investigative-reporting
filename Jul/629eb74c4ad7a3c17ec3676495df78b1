THE Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola has deleted a Facebook and Twitter post in which he seemingly mocked incumbent Governor Adegboyega Oyetola over his loss in the just concluded Osun State gubernatorial election. The post, made via his verified  official pages, was titled, ‘Osun Le Tente‘, a phrase that could be roughly translated as ‘Osun remains on top’. The post read, “This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.” – (Daniel 4:17)” Oyetola, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), lost the election to Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Meanwhile, the minister later took down the post, while Sola Fasure, his media aide, said the post was not authorised. Fafure’s tweet titled ‘Media Advice: Ignore Unauthorised Message Posted on Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola’s Social Media Pages’, read: “It has come to the attention of the media office of the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, that an unauthorized message was posted on his verified Twitter and Facebook pages at about 8:00 am on Sunday, 17th July, 2022.  Aregbesola, Oyetola’s predecessor, had publicly moved against Oyetola’s second-term bid although they are both members of the APC. Instead, Aregbesola endorsed the former Secretary to the State Government, Moshood Adeoti, who later lost to Oyetola in the APC governorship primary election held on February 19. Since then, there has been an alleged feud between Aregbesola and the governor. The minister travelled out of Nigeria on Friday, boycotting Saturday’s governorship election in his state.
