CANDIDATE of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in last month’s governorship election in Ekiti State Segun Oni has challenged the outcome of the poll at the State Election Tribunal. According to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate Biodun Oyebanji won the election with 187,057 votes. Oni came second with 82,211 votes. Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was third with 67,457 votes. Although the election was relatively peaceful, there were, however, reported cases of vote-buying. Addressing Journalists shortly after filing the suit on Thursday at the High Court premises in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, Oni said he was challenging the outcome of the election because he believes he won. “I’m here to submit my petition in accordance with the law and we are doing this to defend the sanctity of the system,” he said. “I challenging the election result because I believe that I won.” Oni’s lawyer, Obafemi Adewale (SAN) said his client also believed that the person declared winner by INEC did not win with lawful votes.
