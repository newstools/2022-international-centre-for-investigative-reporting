Although there were reservations by some of the aspirants, they are adjudged the accreditation exercise to be credible. The ICIR had earlier reported how some delegates from the Ido-Osi Local Government Area of the state had protested what they called a doctored list of delegates from the national headquarters of the party. However, calm was restored shortly after the intervention of Governor Emmanuel.
