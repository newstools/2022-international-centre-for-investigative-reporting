The Service warned residents to stop putting their lives at risk by scooping spilled fuel. “The public is advised to exercise caution along the axis as the evacuation of the burnt tanker progresses, while outbound Lagos vehicular traffic has been temporarily diverted to inbound,” the statement read in part.
