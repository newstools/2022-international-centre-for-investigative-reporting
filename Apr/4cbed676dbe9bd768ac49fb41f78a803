Earlier in May 2021, a military Beechcraft 350 aircraft crashed in Kaduna, leading to the death of former Chief of Army Staff Ibrahim Attahiru. In February 2021, seven officers of the Nigerian Air force died in a crash close to the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport in Abuja after reporting an engine failure en route Minna, Niger State. Also, in April 2021, two Nigerian Air Force pilots were killed after a Fighter jet belonging to the Force went missing.
