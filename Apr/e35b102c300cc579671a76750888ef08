A FORMER governor of Lagos State Bola Tinubu commenced a meeting with some All Progressives Congress (APC) governors just a few hours after Vice President Yemi Osinbajo declared his interest to contest the 2023 presidential election. The meeting, which might be connected to Tinubu’s presidential ambition, is being held behind closed doors at the Kebbi State Governor’s Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja. The development is coming less than 24 hours after Vice President Yemi Osinbajo hosted the governors at his Aguda House official residence on Sunday evening, where he disclosed his intention to contest the APC presidential ticket.
