Asked to comment on the presidential declaration of his political godson, Osinbajo, Tinubu said, “I don’t have any son grown up enough to make such declaration.” Osinbajo served as a commissioner under Tinubu’s administration in Lagos State. Also, it is widely believed that Tinubu played a major role in Osinbajo’s emergence as vice president. The ICIR reported on Monday that Osinbajo officially declared his intention to succeed Buhari. In a message he posted on Twitter, Osinbajo said his experience as Nigeria’s vice president for seven years had given him the capacity to effectively lead the country. He also called for the support of all Nigerians.
