BILLIONAIRE investor and businessman, Elon Musk has clinched the deal to buy microblogging site Twitter. The site was bought for $44 billion in a transaction that was closed on Monday. Though the success of the deal seemed uncertain over the past few days, members of Twitter’s Board of Directors have concluded talks with the billionaire, who proposed an unsolicited offer to buy the platform. Musk who is also the boss of electric carmaker Tesla had in early April bought a 9.2 per cent stake in the social media company. Twitter had put in place a so-called “poison pill” defense to fend off Musk. The mechanism would have created difficulties for Musk if he attempted to increase his stake in the company. However, Twitter appears to have made a U-turn after Musk lined up a $46.5 billion financing package for his offer – with funding from his own assets and the backing of Wall Street banking giant Morgan Stanley and other firms. Musk said that he believes that Twitter should be more open and transparent, and also criticised its process of verifying a Twitter account saying it was like “if Kafka had a Magic 8-Ball!”. “I think it’s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,” he said at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Canada.
