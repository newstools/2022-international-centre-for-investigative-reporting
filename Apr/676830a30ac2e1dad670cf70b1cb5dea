CHAIRMAN of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, (NiDCOM) Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has condemned Polish authorities for profiling and detaining Nigerians and other African nationals that fled to Poland after escaping the conflict in Ukraine. Dabiri-Erewa spoke at the Psycho-social Trauma Clinic for Ukraine returnees organised in partnership with the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI).

Meanwhile, a statement released by NIDCOM said the President of Nigerian Students in Ukraine Fehintola Damilola Moses has applauded President Buhari and his team for the “prompt response and rescue of the students from Ukraine”. “He expressed how brutal the situation was and the terrifying experiences most of them faced during the war between Russia and Ukraine. From spending nights in an inadequate bunker to being racially profiled in some instances,” the statement said. The statement also quoted Moses as saying: “We had to boil snow to drink water”. NiDCOM said it is partnering with the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and IDPs (NCFRMI) to provide psychological support to evacuees from Ukriane.
