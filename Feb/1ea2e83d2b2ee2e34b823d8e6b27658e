THE National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has declared suspended head of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Abba Kyari, wanted over alleged drug offences. The Spokesperson for the NDLEA, Femi Babalola, made this known during a press conference in Abuja on Monday. The NDLEA said its investigation revealed that Kyari is a member of an international drug syndicate. Babalola also said Kyari was being wanted for pushing illicit drugs. Earlier in 2021, a warrant of arrest was issued by Otis Wright, a judge in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, on July 26 to provide the accused to answer questions over the alleged bribery.
