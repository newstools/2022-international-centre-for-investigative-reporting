The businessman was reportedly shackled and blindfolded while he was held hostage by the kidnappers for 88 days, and was only released after his family paid 223,000 euros as ransom. Evans and the two others were arraigned over a two-count charge of conspiracy and kidnapping in August 2017. The prosecution closed its case on January 10, 2020, after presenting four witnesses, including Dunu. The defense closed its case on August 3, 2021, after the defendants and Evans’s sister, Ndubuisi Obiechina, testified. Presiding judge Justice Hakeem Oshodi, in his judgment noted that despite the overwhelming evidence against them, the accused persons did not show any remorse for their crimes and had tried to “lie their way out of the charges” during the trial. “The law is the law and must be upheld. The maximum sentence for the crime of kidnapping in Lagos state is life imprisonment, and the court has no powers to exercise its discretion in this regard,” Justice Oshodi stated. The judge however acquitted Ogechi Uchechukwu, Chilaka Ifeanyi and Victor Aduba, three other accused persons in the case.
