The statistics office also disclosed that the prices of goods and services, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 15.60 per cent (year-on-year) in January 2022. “This is 0.87 per cent points lower than the rate recorded in January 2021 (16.47) per cent. “This shows that headline inflation rate slowed down in January when compared to the same month in the previous year,” the NBS said.
