THE State Security Service (SSS) on Wednesday said leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu cannot wear clothes bearing the image of a lion’s head. An SSS director said this during Kanu’s trial before an Abuja Federal High Court presided by Justice Binta Nyako. The IPOB leader is being tried for terrorism and related offences.

He explained that clothes with lion’s head offend the standard operating procedures of the agency. Kanu had pleaded not guilty to a 15-count terrorism charge preferred against him by the Federal Government. His legal team is asking the court to discharge and acquit him without standing trial. Kanu’s lawyers have also filed a preliminary objection challenging the competence of new charges filed against him, as well as the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter.
