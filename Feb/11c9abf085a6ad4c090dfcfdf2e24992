My brother in-law was taken away by the kidnappers. No contact, or random demand, has been made as yet. “These are difficult and trying times for us. While we continue to pray for his safe return, I appeal to his abductors and keepers to release him unharmed to his family and community, Jattu, Uzairue, that he has given much love as a father and respected community leader,” he said.
